# PioneerVSX828KControlService
This is a windows service that can be used to control a Pioneer VSX828K. This is done over TCP so network connection is required. Initially is intended as a way to shutdown/startup amplifier on computer shutdown/startup but might be expanded to include controllers (Taskbar, mobile, web interface, ...)
